    "\n",
    "Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for many years, and is a major force in popular culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you want to compete on Jeopardy, and you're looking for any way to win. In this project, you'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is named jeopardy.csv, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which you can download.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, each row in the dataset represents a single question on a single episode of Jeopardy. Here are explanations of each column:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Show Number - the Jeopardy episode number\n",
    " - Air Date - the date the episode aired\n",
    " - Round - the round of Jeopardy\n",
    " - Category - the category of the question\n",
    " - Value - the number of dollars the correct answer is worth\n",
    " - Question - the text of the question\n",
    " - Answer - the text of the answer"
